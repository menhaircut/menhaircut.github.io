This was reflected in the popular brands of that era, which included:</p><h3>1. Levi's</h3><p>Levi's jeans were a staple of the 60s fashion scene. They were worn by both men and women, and their durable, comfortable design made them perfect for the casual, laid-back style of the era. Levi's jeans were often paired with t-shirts, button-down shirts, and leather jackets, creating a look that was both cool and effortless.</p><h3>2. Converse</h3><p>Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars became a symbol of the counterculture movement in the 60s. The shoes were originally designed for basketball players, but their simple, classic design and affordable price made them a hit with young people across the country. Converse were often worn with jeans and t-shirts, and became a staple of the casual, comfortable style of the 60s.</p><h3>3. Ray-Ban</h3><p>Ray-Ban sunglasses were a must-have accessory in the 60s. The iconic Wayfarer and Aviator styles were worn by celebrities and musicians, and became a symbol of cool and rebellion. Ray-Bans were often paired with leather jackets and denim, and their timeless design continues to be popular today.</p><h2>How Brands Influenced the Culture of the 60s</h2><p>The popular brands of the 60s not only influenced fashion, but also music and the overall lifestyle of the era.
