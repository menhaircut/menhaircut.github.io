These brands represented the changing times and the shift towards a more liberal and rebellious society. In this article, we will take a closer look at some of the most popular brands of the 60s and how they influenced the fashion, music, and lifestyle of that era.</p><h2>Brands that Defined the 60s</h2><p>The 60s were defined by a rebellion against the mainstream culture and a desire for freedom and self-expression. This was reflected in the popular brands of that era, which included:</p><h3>1. Levi's</h3><p>Levi's jeans were a staple of the 60s fashion scene. They were worn by both men and women, and their durable, comfortable design made them perfect for the casual, laid-back style of the era. Levi's jeans were often paired with t-shirts, button-down shirts, and leather jackets, creating a look that was both cool and effortless.</p><h3>2. Converse</h3><p>Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars became a symbol of the counterculture movement in the 60s. The shoes were originally designed for basketball players, but their simple, classic design and affordable price made them a hit with young people across the country. Converse were often worn with jeans and t-shirts, and became a staple of the casual, comfortable style of the 60s.</p><h3>3. Ray-Ban</h3><p>Ray-Ban sunglasses were a must-have accessory in the 60s. The iconic Wayfarer and Aviator styles were worn by celebrities and musicians, and became a symbol of cool and rebellion. Ray-Bans were often paired with leather jackets and denim, and their timeless design continues to be popular today.</p><h2>How Brands Influenced the Culture of the 60s</h2><p>The popular brands of the 60s not only influenced fashion, but also music and the overall lifestyle of the era. These brands represented a rejection of the conservative values of the past, and a desire for freedom and self-expression.</p><p>The music of the 60s was heavily influenced by the counterculture movement, and many musicians, such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, became style icons in their own right.

Women often wore their hair in bouffant or beehive styles, while men favored long, shaggy haircuts.</p><p>To achieve the iconic bouffant or beehive style, women would tease their hair to create volume, and then use hairspray to hold the style in place. This style was often paired with a headband or scarf to complete the look.</p><p>Men's haircuts of the 60s were often long and shaggy, with bangs that fell over the forehead.
