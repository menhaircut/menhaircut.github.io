Secure the roller in place with a clip or pin.</li><li>Repeat with all sections of hair. For best results, roll your hair in the same direction.</li><li>Leave the rollers in your hair for at least 20 minutes, or until they have cooled completely.</li><li>Remove the rollers and gently finger-comb your hair to create loose, bouncy curls. Finish with a light-hold hairspray to keep your curls in place.</li></ol><h3>Pro tip:</h3><p>For extra volume, flip your head upside-down and blow dry your hair for a few minutes before removing the electric rollers.
