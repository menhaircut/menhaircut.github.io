These stores offered everything from medicine to cosmetics to snacks.</p><p>One of the most popular drugstores of the time was Walgreens. Founded in 1901, Walgreens had over 1,000 stores across the US by the end of the 60s. They were known for their low prices and their wide selection of products.</p><p>Another popular drugstore chain was Rexall. Founded in 1903, Rexall had over 12,000 stores across the US by the end of the 60s. They were known for their high-quality products and their famous "One Cent Sale," which offered customers a second item for just a penny.</p><h2 id="convenience-stores">Convenience Stores</h2><p>While convenience stores weren't as popular in the 60s as they are today, there were still plenty of options for shoppers on the go.</p><p>One popular convenience store chain was 7-Eleven. Founded in 1927, 7-Eleven had over 10,000 stores across the world by the end of the 60s.
