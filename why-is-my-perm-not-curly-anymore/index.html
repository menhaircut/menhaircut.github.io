ThriftyFun</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>Perms are a great way to add some curl and body to your hair. However, it can be frustrating when your perm doesn't last as long as you expected it to. If you're wondering why your perm isn't as curly as it used to be, this article is for you. In this blog post, we'll discuss the reasons why your perm might not be as curly anymore, how to fix it, and how to take care of your hair after a perm.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Perming is a chemical process that changes the structure of your hair. It involves using a chemical solution to break the bonds in your hair, then reforming them in a new shape. Perms can be done to add curls, waves, or volume to your hair. However, the result of a perm can vary depending on various factors such as hair type, texture, and the quality of the perm solution used.</p><h2>How to Know If Your Perm is Not Curly Anymore?</h2><p>If you're not sure if your perm is not curly anymore, here are some signs to look out for:</p><ul><li>Your hair is limp and flat</li><li>Your curls are loose and undefined</li><li>Your hair is frizzy and dry</li><li>Your hair is not holding the curl as long as it used to</li></ul><h2>Step by Step Guide on How to Fix Your Perm</h2><h3>Step 1: Identify the Problem</h3><p>The first step in fixing your perm is to identify the problem. The reason why your perm is not curly anymore could be due to various factors such as:</p><ul><li>Damage to the hair</li><li>Overprocessing during the perm</li><li>Using the wrong perm solution</li><li>Not leaving the perm solution on long enough</li></ul><h3>Step 2: Consult with a Professional Stylist</h3><p>If you're not sure what the problem is, it's best to consult with a professional stylist. They can assess the condition of your hair and recommend the best course of action. They can also suggest a different type of perm that might work better for you.</p><h3>Step 3: Deep Condition Your Hair</h3><p>If your perm is not as curly as it used to be due to damage, you can try deep conditioning your hair. This will help to restore moisture and elasticity to your hair, which can help to bring back the curls. Use a good quality deep conditioner that is designed for permed hair and leave it on for at least 30 minutes before rinsing it off.</p><h3>Step 4: Use the Right Products</h3><p>Using the right products can make a big difference in the health and appearance of your permed hair. Use products that are specifically designed for permed hair, such as shampoos and conditioners. Avoid using products that contain harsh chemicals or sulfates, as these can strip the hair of its natural oils and cause damage.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair with Care</h3><p>When styling your permed hair, be gentle and avoid using heat styling tools too often. Heat can cause damage to your hair and make your curls looser. Use a diffuser when blow-drying your hair to help enhance your curls. You can also use a curling iron or rollers to touch up your curls, but be careful not to overdo it.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Curly Permed Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining curly permed hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid washing your hair too often</li><li>Avoid using hot water when washing your hair</li><li>Use a leave-in conditioner to keep your hair moisturized</li><li>Avoid using hair ties that can cause breakage</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair healthy</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: How long does a perm last?</h3><p>A: A perm can last anywhere from 3 to 6 months, depending on various factors such as hair type, texture, and how well you take care of your hair.</p><h3>Q: Can I color my permed hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can color your permed hair. However, it's best to wait at least a week after getting a perm before coloring your hair.</p><h3>Q: Can I straighten my permed hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can straighten your permed hair, but it's best to avoid doing it too often. Heat styling can cause damage to your hair and make your curls looser.</p><h2>Hair Care for Permed Hair</h2><p>Permed hair requires special care to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips for taking care of your permed hair:</p><ul><li>Use products that are specifically designed for permed hair</li><li>Avoid using hot water when washing your hair</li><li>Use a leave-in conditioner to keep your hair moisturized</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often</li><li>Get regular trims to keep your hair healthy</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>If you're wondering why your perm is not as curly as it used to be, there could be various reasons for it. The best way to fix it is to identify the problem and take steps to correct it. With the right care and maintenance, you can keep your permed hair looking beautiful and curly for months to come.</p></article>
