One of the easiest ways to achieve a vintage look is by backcombing your hair. Backcombing, also known as teasing or ratting, was a popular hair styling technique in the 1960s. It involves teasing the hair at the roots to create volume and texture. In this article, we’ll show you how to backcomb hair 60s style with a step-by-step guide, helpful tips, and answers to frequently asked questions.</p><h2>How to Backcomb Hair 60s Style</h2><p>Before we get started, make sure you have the right tools on hand. You’ll need a fine-toothed comb, a teasing brush, hairspray, and hairpins or clips. Here’s how to backcomb hair 60s style:</p><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start with clean, dry hair. Comb through any tangles or knots and apply a heat protectant spray if you plan on using heat styling tools. If your hair is naturally curly or wavy, you may want to straighten it first.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections using clips or hairpins. The size of the sections will depend on how thick your hair is and how much volume you want to create. For a more dramatic 60s look, use smaller sections.</p><h3>Step 3: Tease Your Hair</h3><p>Starting with one section, take a small section of hair at the crown and hold it straight up. Using a fine-toothed comb or teasing brush, gently backcomb the hair towards the scalp in short strokes. Repeat this process until you’ve teased the entire section. You should be left with a voluminous, tangled mess of hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Set Your Tease</h3><p>Once you’ve teased all the sections, use your fingers or a comb to smooth the top layer of hair over the teased sections. This will hide the tangles and give your hair a more polished look. Finish with a light mist of hairspray to set your tease in place.</p><h2>Tips for Backcombing Hair 60s Style</h2><p>Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when backcombing your hair 60s style:</p><ul><li>Start with small sections of hair and work your way up to larger sections as you become more comfortable with the technique.</li><li>Be gentle when teasing your hair – you don’t want to break or damage your hair.</li><li>Use a teasing brush instead of a comb for a softer, more natural-looking tease.</li><li>Experiment with different styles and shapes – backcombing can be used to create a variety of looks, from bouffants to beehives.</li><li>Don’t overdo it with the hairspray – a light misting is all you need to set your tease.</li></ul><h2>FAQ About Backcombing Hair 60s Style</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about backcombing hair 60s style:</p><h3>Is backcombing bad for your hair?</h3><p>Backcombing can cause damage to your hair if done too frequently or aggressively. Be sure to use a gentle touch and avoid backcombing every day.</p><h3>How long does backcombing last?</h3><p>Backcombing can last anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending on your hair type and the amount of hairspray you use to set your tease.</p><h3>Can backcombing be undone?</h3><p>Yes, backcombing can be undone by gently combing out the tangles with a wide-toothed comb or brush. Be sure to use a conditioning treatment afterwards to help restore any damaged hair.</p><h2>Hair Care for Backcombed Hair</h2><p>Backcombing can put stress on your hair, so it’s important to take extra care when washing and styling your hair. Here are some tips to help keep your hair healthy:</p><ul><li>Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner that won’t strip your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often, as they can cause further damage to your hair.</li><li>Use a wide-toothed comb or brush to gently detangle your hair after backcombing.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to help nourish and protect your hair.</li></ul><p>Backcombing your hair 60s style is a fun and easy way to add some retro flair to your look. With a little practice and some helpful tips, you’ll be able to create a variety of vintage-inspired styles that are sure to turn heads.</p></article>
