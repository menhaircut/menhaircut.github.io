Retro hairstyles, 70s hair and makeup</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>The 70s is known for its iconic fashion, and one of the most recognizable hairstyles of the era is the bangs curly hair look. If you're looking to channel your inner disco diva, you're in luck because this style is making a comeback in 2023. In this blog post, we'll show you how to achieve this retro look, step by step. We'll also provide tips on how to maintain it and answer some frequently asked questions. So, let's get started!</p><h2>How to Get 70s Style Bangs Curly Hair</h2><p>Before we dive into the steps, it's important to note that this style works best on naturally curly or wavy hair. If you have straight hair, you can still achieve this look with the help of a curling iron or perm. Here's how to get the 70s style bangs curly hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean, Dry Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair and let it air dry or use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to enhance your natural curls. Once your hair is completely dry, comb it out to remove any tangles.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section off the top layer of your hair, starting at the crown of your head. Clip it out of the way for now.</p><h3>Step 3: Create Your Bangs</h3><p>Take a small section of hair from the front of your head and comb it forward. Cut your bangs to your desired length, keeping in mind that they will spring up a bit once they dry. Start by cutting them longer than you think you want them, and then trim them little by little until you're happy with the length.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut Layers</h3><p>Release the top layer of your hair and divide it into small sections. Cut each section at an angle to create layers. The layers should be shorter towards the front of your head and longer towards the back.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Apply a curl defining cream or mousse to your hair, focusing on the ends. Scrunch your hair with your hands to create curls. For extra volume, flip your head upside down and scrunch your hair some more. Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to dry your hair or let it air dry. Once your hair is dry, use a pick comb to fluff up your curls and give them more volume.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining 70s Style Bangs Curly Hair</h2><p>Now that you have your 70s style bangs curly hair, here are some tips to keep it looking its best:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your curls hydrated.</li><li>Avoid brushing your curls, as this can cause frizz. Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair.</li><li>Sleep on a satin pillowcase to prevent frizz and breakage.</li><li>Refresh your curls between washes with a curl refreshing spray.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I achieve this style on straight hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can achieve this style on straight hair with the help of a curling iron or perm. However, it's important to note that this style works best on naturally curly or wavy hair.</p><h3>How often should I wash my hair?</h3><p>It's best to wash your hair every 2-3 days to prevent it from becoming dry and brittle. However, this can vary depending on your hair type and lifestyle.</p><h3>What products should I use?</h3><p>Use a curl defining cream or mousse to enhance your curls. You can also use a leave-in conditioner to keep your hair moisturized. Avoid using products that contain sulfates, as they can strip your hair of its natural oils.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>It's important to take care of your hair to maintain its health and prevent damage. Here are some hair care tips:</p><ul><li>Trim your hair regularly every 6-8 weeks to prevent split ends.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools too often, as they can damage your hair. If you do use them, use a heat protectant spray.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals to promote hair growth and strength.</li><li>Avoid tight hairstyles that can cause tension and breakage, such as tight ponytails and braids.</li></ul><p>With these tips and steps, you can channel your inner disco queen and rock the 70s style bangs curly hair look in 2023. So, put on your favorite disco playlist and get ready to boogie!</p></article>
