Look no further! In this blog post, we will discuss the top hairstyles that will flatter your face shape and enhance your beauty. We will also provide tips on how to maintain your hairstyle and take care of your hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A round face is characterized by a wide forehead, full cheeks, and a rounded chin. If you have a plus size round face, you want to choose a hairstyle that will elongate your face and create the illusion of a slimmer face. You also want to avoid hairstyles that will make your face look rounder.</p><h2>How to Choose the Best Hairstyle for Plus Size Round Face</h2><p>When choosing a hairstyle for your plus size round face, there are a few things to consider:</p><h3>1. Length</h3><p>The length of your hair can make a big difference in how your face looks. A long hairstyle can elongate your face, while a short hairstyle can make your face look rounder. If you have a plus size round face, consider a hairstyle that falls between your chin and shoulders.</p><h3>2. Layers</h3><p>Layers can add volume and movement to your hair, which can be flattering if you have a round face. However, too many layers can make your face look fuller. If you have a plus size round face, consider a hairstyle with long layers that start below your chin.</p><h3>3. Bangs</h3><p>Bangs can be a great way to frame your face and draw attention to your eyes. However, not all bangs are created equal. If you have a plus size round face, consider side-swept bangs that are longer on the sides and shorter in the middle. Avoid blunt bangs that end at your eyebrows, as they can make your face look rounder.</p><h3>4. Texture</h3><p>Adding texture to your hair can create the illusion of a slimmer face. Consider a hairstyle with waves or curls, as they can add volume and movement to your hair. Avoid hairstyles that are too straight, as they can make your face look rounder.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide on Best Hairstyle for Plus Size Round Face</h2><h3>Step 1: Determine Your Face Shape</h3><p>Before choosing a hairstyle, determine your face shape. You can do this by pulling your hair back and examining the shape of your face in the mirror. If you have a round face, your face will be as wide as it is long, with a wide forehead, full cheeks, and a rounded chin.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose a Length</h3><p>If you have a plus size round face, consider a hairstyle that falls between your chin and shoulders. This length will help elongate your face and create the illusion of a slimmer face.</p><h3>Step 3: Add Layers</h3><p>Layers can add volume and movement to your hair, which can be flattering if you have a round face. However, too many layers can make your face look fuller. If you have a plus size round face, consider a hairstyle with long layers that start below your chin.</p><h3>Step 4: Consider Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs can be a great way to frame your face and draw attention to your eyes. If you have a plus size round face, consider side-swept bangs that are longer on the sides and shorter in the middle. Avoid blunt bangs that end at your eyebrows, as they can make your face look rounder.</p><h3>Step 5: Add Texture</h3><p>Adding texture to your hair can create the illusion of a slimmer face. Consider a hairstyle with waves or curls, as they can add volume and movement to your hair. Avoid hairstyles that are too straight, as they can make your face look rounder.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Hairstyle</h2><p>Once you’ve chosen the perfect hairstyle for your plus size round face, it’s important to maintain it. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Trim Your Hair</h3><p>Regular trims will help keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends. Aim to get a trim every 6-8 weeks.</p><h3>2. Use the Right Products</h3><p>Use products that are designed for your hair type and texture. If you have curly hair, use products that enhance your curls. If you have straight hair, use products that add volume and texture.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair</h3><p>Protect your hair from heat damage by using a heat protectant spray before using hot tools. You should also avoid using hot tools on wet hair.</p><h3>4. Wash Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Wash your hair regularly to keep it clean and healthy. However, avoid washing your hair every day, as this can strip your hair of its natural oils.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What kind of hairstyle should I avoid if I have a plus size round face?</h3><p>Avoid hairstyles that are too short or too blunt, as they can make your face look rounder. You should also avoid hairstyles that are too straight, as they can make your face look wider.</p><h3>What kind of bangs should I avoid if I have a plus size round face?</h3><p>Avoid blunt bangs that end at your eyebrows, as they can make your face look rounder. Instead, opt for side-swept bangs that are longer on the sides and shorter in the middle.</p><h2>Hair Care for Plus Size Round Face</h2><h3>1. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb</h3><p>Use a wide-tooth comb instead of a brush to detangle your hair. This will prevent breakage and keep your hair healthy.</p><h3>2. Deep Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Deep condition your hair once a week to keep it moisturized and healthy.</p><h3>3. Protect Your Hair from the Sun</h3><p>Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a hair product with SPF.</p><h3>4. Avoid Overstyling Your Hair</h3><p>Avoid overstyling your hair with heat tools, as this can damage your hair and make it look unhealthy.</p><p>In conclusion, choosing the best hairstyle for your plus size round face is all about creating the illusion of a slimmer face. Consider a hairstyle that falls between your chin and shoulders, has long layers, side-swept bangs, and adds texture to your hair. Don’t forget to maintain your hairstyle by trimming your hair regularly, using the right products, protecting your hair, and washing your hair regularly. With these tips, you’ll have a beautiful and flattering hairstyle that enhances your natural beauty.</p></article>
