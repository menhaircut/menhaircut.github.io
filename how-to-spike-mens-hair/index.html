Take a small amount of your chosen hair product and rub it between your palms to warm it up. <br/> 3. Apply the product to your hair, starting at the roots and working your way up to the tips. Be sure to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair. <br/> 4. Use your fingers or a comb to style your hair into the desired shape. If you're going for a spiky look, use your fingertips to create spikes by pulling your hair upwards. <br/> 5. To make your spikes last longer, use a hair spray to set them in place. Hold the spray can about 6 inches away from your head and spray evenly all over your hair. <br/> 6. If you want a more natural look, you can use a hair wax or pomade instead of a hair gel. These products provide a softer hold and add shine to your hair. <br/><h2 id="tips"> Tips for Spiking Men's Hair </h2> Here are some tips to keep in mind when spiking men's hair: <ul><li>Start with a small amount of hair product and add more as needed.
