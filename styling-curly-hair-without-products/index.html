Here’s how to do it:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Avoid using hot water, as it can strip your hair of its natural oils and cause frizz.</li><li>Gently comb your hair with a wide-tooth comb to detangle any knots. Start from the bottom and work your way up to avoid causing breakage.</li><li>Use a microfiber towel or t-shirt to gently squeeze out excess water. Avoid rubbing your hair, as it can cause frizz.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections using hair clips. Begin with the bottom layer and work your way up.</li><li>Take a section of hair and twist it around your finger to create a coil. Continue twisting until you reach the root of your hair.</li><li>Repeat this process on each section of hair until your entire head is twisted. For tighter curls, twist smaller sections of hair. For looser curls, twist larger sections of hair.</li><li>Once your hair is fully twisted, use a hair dryer with a diffuser attachment to dry your hair. Set the dryer to low heat and low speed to avoid causing frizz. If you don’t have a hair dryer, you can air dry your hair instead. </li><li>Once your hair is dry, gently unravel each twist. Use your fingers to separate the curls and create volume.</li><li>If you have any frizz, you can use a small amount of coconut oil or argan oil to smooth it down. Rub the oil between your palms and apply it to the frizzy areas.</li><li>Finish by using a wide-tooth comb to gently shape and define your curls.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Styling Curly Hair Without Products</h2><p>Here are some additional tips that can help you achieve beautiful, natural-looking curls without using any hair products:</p><ul><li>Avoid using hot tools, such as curling irons or straighteners, as they can damage your hair and cause breakage.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it’s dry, as it can cause frizz and breakage.
