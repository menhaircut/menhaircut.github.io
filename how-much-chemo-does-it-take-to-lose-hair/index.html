Pat your hair dry with a soft towel and avoid rubbing it vigorously. You can also use a wide-tooth comb or a soft brush to detangle your hair gently.</p><h3>Step 2: Protect Your Scalp</h3><p>Your scalp may become sensitive during chemotherapy. To protect it, you can wear a soft cap or scarf to bed.
