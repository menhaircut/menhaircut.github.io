It affects how you feel, think, and behave and can lead to a variety of physical symptoms, including hair loss.</p><h2 id="how-depression-can-cause-hair-loss">How Depression Can Cause Hair Loss</h2><p>Depression can cause hair loss in several ways. Firstly, depression can cause physical changes in your body, such as an increase in cortisol levels.

When cortisol levels are high, your body's immune system can become weakened, which can lead to hair loss.</p><p>Secondly, depression can cause you to engage in behaviors that can lead to hair loss. For example, if you are feeling depressed, you may neglect your hair care routine, which can lead to breakage and hair loss. Additionally, some people with depression may engage in hair-pulling behaviors, such as trichotillomania, which can also lead to hair loss.</p><h2 id="other-causes-of-hair-loss">Other Causes of Hair Loss</h2><p>While depression can contribute to hair loss, there are other causes to consider as well.
