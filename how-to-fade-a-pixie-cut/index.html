They can provide expert advice and ensure that you achieve the look you want. <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2> Here are some frequently asked questions about fading a pixie cut: <b>Q: How long does it take to fade a pixie cut?</b><br> A: The time it takes to fade a pixie cut depends on the length of your hair and the technique you use.
