It is a low-maintenance, long-lasting hairstyle that can be achieved with natural hair. If you're wondering how to get dreads natural hair, this guide will walk you through the process step by step. Whether you're starting from scratch or have already begun the process, here are some tips to help you achieve that coveted dreadlock style.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#step1">Step 1: Let Your Hair Grow</a></li><li><a href="#step2">Step 2: Wash and Condition Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step3">Step 3: Section Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step4">Step 4: Backcomb Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step5">Step 5: Palm Roll Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step6">Step 6: Maintenance and Care</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Getting Dreads Natural Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li><li><a href="#haircare">Hair Care for Dreads Natural Hair</a></li></ul><h2 id="step1">Step 1: Let Your Hair Grow</h2><p>The first step in getting dreads natural hair is to let your hair grow. Dreads need a certain length to form properly, so you'll need to be patient and let your hair grow out. This process can take anywhere from a few months to a year or more, depending on your hair type and the length you're aiming for.</p><p>During this time, it's important to keep your hair healthy and moisturized. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to minimize breakage and damage. You can also use oils and leave-in conditioners to add moisture and promote healthy hair growth. </p><h2 id="step2">Step 2: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h2><p>Before you begin the process of dreading your hair, it's important to start with clean, conditioned hair. Wash and condition your hair thoroughly, making sure to remove any buildup or residue. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any products or oils that may be on your hair.</p><p>After washing, use a deep conditioner or hair masque to add moisture and nourishment to your hair. This will help your hair stay healthy and strong throughout the dreading process.</p><h2 id="step3">Step 3: Section Your Hair</h2><p>Once your hair is clean and conditioned, it's time to section it off. Use a comb to create even sections of hair, starting at the nape of your neck and working your way up. The size of your sections will depend on the size of the dreads you want to create. Smaller sections will result in smaller dreads, while larger sections will create bigger dreads.</p><p>Use hair ties or clips to keep each section separate and organized. This will make it easier to backcomb and palm roll your hair in the next steps.</p><h2 id="step4">Step 4: Backcomb Your Hair</h2><p>Backcombing is a technique that helps to create the knots and tangles that form the basis of dreadlocks. Take one section of your hair at a time and use a fine-tooth comb to backcomb it from the tips to the roots. This will create a tangled, knotted effect that will eventually form into a dreadlock.</p><p>Repeat this process for each section of hair, making sure to backcomb evenly and thoroughly. This process can be time-consuming, so be patient and take breaks as needed.</p><h2 id="step5">Step 5: Palm Roll Your Hair</h2><p>Palm rolling is another technique that helps to shape your hair into dreadlocks. Take each section of hair and roll it between your palms, working from the roots to the tips. This will help to smooth out any bumps or lumps and create a more uniform dreadlock shape.</p><p>Repeat this process for each section of hair, making sure to roll evenly and thoroughly. You can also use a dreadlock wax or gel to help hold the shape and maintain the style.</p><h2 id="step6">Step 6: Maintenance and Care</h2><p>Once you've created your natural hair dreads, it's important to maintain and care for them properly. This includes regular washing and conditioning, as well as occasional re-twisting and palm rolling to keep the shape and texture of your dreads.</p><p>You can also use a natural oil or spray to add moisture and prevent dryness or breakage. Avoid using heavy products or oils that can weigh down your hair and cause buildup or damage.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Getting Dreads Natural Hair</h2><ul><li>Be patient and allow your hair to grow out before starting the dreading process</li><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to minimize damage and breakage</li><li>Section your hair evenly to create uniform dreads</li><li>Backcomb and palm roll each section thoroughly and evenly</li><li>Use a natural oil or spray to add moisture and prevent dryness or breakage</li></ul><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>How long does it take to get dreads natural hair?</h3><p>The time it takes to get dreads natural hair can vary depending on your hair type and the length you're aiming for. It can take anywhere from a few months to a year or more to achieve the desired length and texture.</p><h3>Do I need to use wax or gel to maintain my dreads?</h3><p>No, you don't necessarily need to use wax or gel to maintain your dreads. However, these products can help to hold the shape and texture of your dreads and make them easier to maintain.</p><h3>Can I wash my dreads?</h3><p>Yes, you can and should wash your dreads regularly to keep them clean and healthy.
