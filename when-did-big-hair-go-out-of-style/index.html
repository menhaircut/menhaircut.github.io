First, you will need to invest in some quality hair products, including volumizing shampoo, conditioner, and hairspray. You may also want to consider using hot rollers, a curling iron, or a round brush to create volume and lift.</p><p>Once you have the right products and tools, you can start by washing and conditioning your hair. Then, apply a volumizing mousse or spray to your roots and blow-dry your hair upside down to create lift. Next, use a curling iron or hot rollers to create curls or waves. Finally, finish off the look with a generous amount of hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve big hair:</p><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair using volumizing products.</li><li>Apply a volumizing mousse or spray to your roots.</li><li>Blow-dry your hair upside down to create lift.</li><li>Use a curling iron or hot rollers to create curls or waves.</li><li>Tease your hair at the crown to create more volume.</li><li>Finish off the look with a generous amount of hairspray.</li></ol><h2>Tips for Maintaining Big Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips for maintaining big hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid washing your hair too often, as this can strip it of natural oils and make it harder to style.</li><li>Use a dry shampoo to refresh your hair between washes.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair too much, as this can flatten the volume.</li><li>When sleeping, use a satin pillowcase to prevent frizz and breakage.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, as this can damage it and make it harder to style.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What other hairstyles were popular in the 1990s?</h3><p>In the 1990s, other popular hairstyles included the Rachel cut, the bob, and the pixie cut.</p><h3>What products should I use to achieve big hair?</h3><p>You should use volumizing shampoo, conditioner, mousse or spray, and hairspray.</p><h3>Is big hair making a comeback?</h3><p>While big hair has not yet made a full comeback, some elements of the style have been seen on the runway and in fashion magazines.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Regardless of the hairstyle you choose, it is important to take good care of your hair.
