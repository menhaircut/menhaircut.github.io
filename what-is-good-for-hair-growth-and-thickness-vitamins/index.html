Biotin, in particular, is often cited as one of the best vitamins for hair growth, as it helps to strengthen hair strands and promote healthy growth. You can find B vitamins in a variety of foods, including eggs, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. B vitamin supplements are also available, and are often included in hair growth supplements. <h2 id="vitaminC">Vitamin C</h2> Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that helps to protect the body from free radical damage, which can contribute to hair loss and thinning. This vitamin also helps to produce collagen, which is a protein that helps to strengthen hair strands and promote healthy growth. Good food sources of vitamin C include citrus fruits, berries, and leafy greens. Vitamin C supplements are also available, and can be found in many multivitamin and hair growth supplements. <h2 id="vitaminD">Vitamin D</h2> Vitamin D is important for healthy hair growth, as it helps to stimulate hair follicles and promote healthy growth. This vitamin also helps to regulate the immune system, which can help to prevent hair loss and thinning. Good food sources of vitamin D include fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified dairy products. Vitamin D supplements are also available, and can be found in many multivitamin and hair growth supplements. <h2 id="vitaminE">Vitamin E</h2> Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that helps to protect the body from free radical damage, which can contribute to hair loss and thinning.
