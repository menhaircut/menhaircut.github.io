YouTube</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>If you're tired of spending a fortune at the hair salon just to get your hair trimmed, you might consider cutting it yourself. However, cutting the back of your hair can be tricky, especially if you don't have a second pair of hands to help. In this article, we'll show you how to cut the back of your hair straight yourself, so you can save money and still look great.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Cutting the back of your hair can be intimidating, but it's not as hard as it looks. With the right tools and a little patience, you can get a straight and even cut every time. In this guide, we'll show you how to cut the back of your hair step-by-step, including tips for getting the perfect cut.</p><h2>How to Cut the Back of Your Hair Straight Yourself</h2><p>Follow these steps to cut the back of your hair straight yourself:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, you'll need to gather some tools. You'll need a pair of hair cutting scissors, a comb, and two mirrors. One mirror should be a full-length mirror, and the other should be a smaller mirror that you can hold in your hand.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair before you start cutting it. This will make it easier to see the length and shape of your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Divide Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into two sections. Use your comb to part your hair down the middle, from the crown of your head to the nape of your neck.</p><h3>Step 4: Hold the Mirror</h3><p>Hold the smaller mirror in your hand and stand in front of the larger mirror. Hold the smaller mirror behind your head so you can see the back of your hair in the larger mirror.</p><h3>Step 5: Cut the Hair</h3><p>Use your hair cutting scissors to cut the hair in a straight line. Start at the center of your head and work your way outwards.</p><h3>Step 6: Check Your Progress</h3><p>Check your progress by looking in the mirror as you cut. Make sure the hair is even on both sides and that the length is the same.</p><h3>Step 7: Trim Any Stray Hairs</h3><p>Trim any stray hairs that you missed. Use your comb to comb through your hair and look for any hairs that are longer than the rest.</p><h3>Step 8: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Style your hair as desired. You can blow dry it, curl it, or straighten it.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you cut the back of your hair straight:</p><ul><li>Use sharp hair cutting scissors to get a clean cut.</li><li>Don't cut too much hair at once. It's better to cut a little bit at a time and check your progress.</li><li>If you're not sure about the length, start with a longer length and work your way down.</li><li>Be patient. It may take a few tries to get the hang of cutting the back of your hair.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting the back of your hair:</p><h3>Can I cut the back of my hair myself?</h3><p>Yes, you can cut the back of your hair yourself. With the right tools and a little patience, you can get a straight and even cut every time.</p><h3>How do I cut the back of my hair by myself?</h3><p>Follow the steps outlined in this guide to cut the back of your hair by yourself.

Alternatively, you can try to fix it yourself by trimming any stray hairs.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Cutting your hair can be a great way to save money and get the look you want.
