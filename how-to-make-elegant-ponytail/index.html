Step 4: Smooth out any bumps  If you notice any bumps or unevenness in your ponytail, use your brush to smooth them out. This will help create a sleek and polished look.  Step 5: Add some volume  To add some volume to your ponytail, gently tease the hair at the crown of your head using a comb. This will create a fuller, more voluminous look.
