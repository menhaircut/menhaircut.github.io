In many religions, covering the hair is seen as a symbol of modesty and piety. In this article, we will explore which religions require women to cover their hair and why.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#islam">Islam</a></li><li><a href="#judaism">Judaism</a></li><li><a href="#christianity">Christianity</a></li><li><a href="#sikhism">Sikhism</a></li><li><a href="#hinduism">Hinduism</a></li><li><a href="#buddhism">Buddhism</a></li></ul><h2 id="islam">Islam</h2><p>In Islam, covering the hair is considered a religious obligation for women who have reached puberty.
