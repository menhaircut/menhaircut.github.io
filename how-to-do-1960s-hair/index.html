Look no further! In this blog post, we'll show you how to do 1960s hair in a few simple steps. From the famous beehive to the chic pixie cut, we've got you covered with all the tips and tricks you need to achieve a stunning 1960s look.</p><h2>How to Do a 1960s Beehive</h2><p>The beehive was one of the most iconic hairstyles of the 1960s. This classic 'do is characterized by its voluminous shape, which resembles a beehive (hence the name). Here's how to do a 1960s beehive:</p><h3>Step 1: Tease Your Hair</h3><p>Start by parting your hair down the middle and teasing the crown section with a fine-tooth comb. This will create the height and volume needed for the beehive.</p><h3>Step 2: Create a Ponytail</h3><p>Gather the teased section of your hair into a ponytail at the crown of your head. Secure it with an elastic band.</p><h3>Step 3: Backcomb Your Ponytail</h3><p>Backcomb the ponytail with a fine-tooth comb to create even more volume. Be sure to smooth out the top layer of hair with a brush or comb.</p><h3>Step 4: Pin the Hair</h3><p>Wrap the ponytail around the elastic band to create a bun shape. Pin the hair in place with bobby pins, making sure to hide the elastic band.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish the beehive by spritzing it with hairspray to hold the style in place. Use a comb to smooth down any flyaways or frizz.</p><p>And there you have it—a classic 1960s beehive!</p><h2>How to Do a 1960s Pixie Cut</h2><p>The pixie cut was another popular hairstyle of the 1960s. This short and sassy 'do is perfect for anyone looking to make a bold statement. Here's how to do a 1960s pixie cut:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Length</h3><p>The key to a great pixie cut is choosing the right length for your face shape. Consult with a hairstylist to determine the best length for you.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the Hair</h3><p>Cut the hair to the desired length, making sure to create layers and texture for added dimension. Use a comb and scissors to trim the hair evenly.</p><h3>Step 3: Style the Hair</h3><p>Apply a small amount of texturizing product to the hair to create a messy, tousled look. Use your fingers to style the hair and add volume where needed.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish the pixie cut by spritzing it with hairspray to hold the style in place. Use a comb to smooth down any flyaways or frizz.</p><p>And there you have it—a chic and stylish 1960s pixie cut!</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining 1960s Hair</h2><p>Now that you know how to do 1960s hair, it's important to maintain the look. Here are a few tips to keep your retro 'do looking its best:</p><ul><li>Use a volumizing shampoo and conditioner to add body and texture to the hair.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on the hair, as this can cause damage and frizz.</li><li>Get regular trims to maintain the shape and length of your hairstyle.</li><li>Invest in quality hair products, such as hairspray and texturizing paste, to keep your hairstyle in place.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Can I do 1960s hair on short hair?</h3><p>A: Yes! The beehive may be more difficult to achieve on short hair, but the pixie cut is a great option for anyone with shorter locks.</p><h3>Q: How do I create a 1960s updo?</h3><p>A: To create a 1960s updo, start by teasing the crown section of your hair to create volume. Pull the hair back into a ponytail or bun and pin in place with bobby pins. Finish with hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><h3>Q: What hair accessories were popular in the 1960s?</h3><p>A: Hair accessories such as headbands, barrettes, and scarves were popular in the 1960s. Incorporate these accessories into your hairstyle for an authentic retro look.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know how to do 1960s hair, you can channel your inner vintage vixen with confidence! Whether you opt for a beehive or a pixie cut, these retro hairstyles are sure to make a statement. Remember to maintain your hairstyle with regular trims and quality hair products to keep your 'do looking its best.</p></article>
