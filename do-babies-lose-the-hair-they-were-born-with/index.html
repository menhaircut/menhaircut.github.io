TTN Baby</u></strong></figcaption></center></figure><p>As a new parent, it can be alarming to see your baby losing their hair. You may wonder if it's normal or if there's something wrong. The good news is that it's perfectly normal for babies to lose the hair they were born with. In fact, it's a natural part of their growth and development.</p><h2>Why Do Babies Lose Their Hair?</h2><p>When babies are born, they have a full head of hair that's often quite thick. However, this hair is not permanent. It's called "lanugo" and it's a type of hair that grows in the womb. After birth, the lanugo hair begins to fall out and is replaced by "vellus" hair, which is thinner and shorter. Vellus hair is the hair that most people have on their bodies, and it's what your baby's hair will eventually become.</p><h3>When Does Hair Loss Typically Occur?</h3><p>Most babies will begin to lose their lanugo hair within the first few weeks of life. This hair loss will continue over the next few months, and by the time your baby is six months old, they will likely have a full head of vellus hair. However, some babies may lose their hair more quickly or more slowly than others.</p><h2>How Can You Help Your Baby's Hair Grow?</h2><p>While there's no way to speed up your baby's hair growth or prevent hair loss, there are a few things you can do to keep their scalp healthy:</p><ul><li>Gently wash your baby's hair with a mild baby shampoo</li><li>Use a soft brush or comb to gently detangle their hair</li><li>Avoid pulling or tugging on their hair</li><li>Make sure your baby is getting all the nutrients they need for healthy hair growth</li></ul><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Is it normal for babies to have bald spots?</h3><p>Yes, it's normal for babies to have bald spots or thinning hair. This is usually due to the position they spend most of their time in, such as lying on their back or sitting in a car seat. The hair should grow back once they start moving around more.</p><h3>When should I be concerned about my baby's hair loss?</h3><p>If your baby is losing hair in clumps or has bald patches that are getting larger, you should talk to your pediatrician. This could be a sign of an underlying medical condition.</p><h3>Will my baby's hair texture change?</h3><p>Yes, it's possible that your baby's hair texture will change as they grow. Some babies are born with curly hair that becomes straighter over time, while others start out with straight hair that becomes curly.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>While it can be concerning to see your baby losing their hair, it's perfectly normal and nothing to worry about. Remember to take good care of their scalp and hair, and if you have any concerns, don't hesitate to talk to your pediatrician.</p></article>
