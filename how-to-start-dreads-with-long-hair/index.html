They are created by twisting and knotting hair until it forms long, ropelike strands. While many people start dreads with short hair, it is possible to start dreads with long hair as well. In this article, we will provide a step-by-step guide on how to start dreads with long hair and offer tips on how to care for them. <h2 id="how-to">How to Start Dreads with Long Hair</h2> Starting dreads with long hair can be a bit more challenging than with short hair, but it is still possible. The process involves sectioning the hair and twisting it until it forms knots. Here are the basic steps to follow: <h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3> Before starting the dreadlocks process, make sure your hair is clean and free of any products. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup and a deep conditioner to moisturize your hair. <h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3> Using a rat-tail comb, section your hair into even parts. The size of the sections will depend on how thick you want your dreads to be. For thicker dreads, section your hair into larger parts. For thinner dreads, section your hair into smaller parts. <h3>Step 3: Twist and Knot Your Hair</h3> Take one section of hair and twist it until it forms a tight rope. Then, knot the twisted hair to create a dreadlock. Repeat this process with each section of hair until your entire head is covered in dreadlocks. <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2> Here is a more detailed step-by-step guide on how to start dreads with long hair: <h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Hair</h3> Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup. Condition your hair with a deep conditioner to moisturize it. <h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3> Using a rat-tail comb, section your hair into even parts. Use hair clips to keep each section separate. <h3>Step 3: Apply Locking Gel</h3> Apply locking gel to each section of hair. This will help hold the twists in place and encourage the hair to knot. <h3>Step 4: Twist Your Hair</h3> Take one section of hair and twist it until it forms a tight rope. Use your fingers to smooth out any bumps or lumps in the twist. <h3>Step 5: Knot Your Hair</h3> Once the hair is twisted, knot it to create a dreadlock. To do this, wrap the twisted hair around itself until it forms a knot. Use a small rubber band or hair tie to secure the knot in place. <h3>Step 6: Repeat the Process</h3> Repeat the twisting and knotting process with each section of hair until your entire head is covered in dreadlocks. <h2 id="tips">Tips for Starting Dreads with Long Hair</h2> Starting dreads with long hair can be a time-consuming process, but it is worth it in the end.
