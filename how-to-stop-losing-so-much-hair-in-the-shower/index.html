Try washing your hair every other day or every two days instead.</p><h3>Use a Gentle Shampoo</h3><p>Look for a shampoo that is gentle and sulfate-free. Sulfates can strip your hair of its natural oils, causing it to become dry and brittle.</p><h3>Rinse with Cold Water</h3><p>Rinsing your hair with cold water can help seal the hair cuticle, preventing damage and reducing hair loss.</p><h3>Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons can cause damage to your hair, leading to breakage and hair loss.
