It's a common problem that affects many people, and it can be frustrating to deal with. But don't worry, there are ways to tame your broken hair and get it back to looking healthy and beautiful. In this article, we'll explore some tips and tricks to help you tame your broken hair on top of your head. </p><h2> How to </h2><p> There are several ways to tame broken hair on top of your head. Here are some tips and tricks you can try: </p><h3> Trim your hair </h3><p> One of the best ways to deal with broken hair on top of your head is to trim it. This will help get rid of split ends and make your hair look healthier. It's best to go to a professional hair stylist for a trim, as they will be able to assess the damage and give you the best advice on how much to cut. </p><h3> Use a nourishing hair mask </h3><p> Using a nourishing hair mask can help repair your broken hair and make it look healthier. Look for a hair mask that contains ingredients like keratin, argan oil, and shea butter, as these are known to help repair damaged hair. Apply the hair mask once a week and leave it on for at least 30 minutes before rinsing it off. </p><h3> Avoid heat styling </h3><p> Heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons can damage your hair and make it more prone to breaking. Try to avoid using these tools as much as possible, or at least use them on a low heat setting. If you must use heat styling tools, be sure to use a heat protectant spray first to help protect your hair from damage. </p><h3> Use a wide-toothed comb </h3><p> When brushing your hair, use a wide-toothed comb instead of a brush. This will help prevent tangles and breakage, as brushes can be harsh on your hair. Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up to the roots, being gentle as you go. </p><h2> Step by Step </h2><p> Here is a step-by-step guide on how to tame broken hair on top of your head: </p><h3> Step 1: Trim your hair </h3><p> Visit a professional hair stylist and get a trim to get rid of split ends and make your hair look healthier. </p><h3> Step 2: Use a nourishing hair mask </h3><p> Apply a nourishing hair mask once a week to help repair your broken hair and make it look healthier. </p><h3> Step 3: Avoid heat styling </h3><p> Try to avoid using heat styling tools as much as possible, or at least use them on a low heat setting.
